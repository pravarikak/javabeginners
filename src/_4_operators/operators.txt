Operators: + - / % (Aritmetic operators)
>,<,<=,>=,==,!= 
&,&&,|,||


Operator is a special symbol that tell compier to perform task on operands(data)

operand: operate on operands => c=a+b;
a, b c are called operands

Operator types are:

unary: ++,--,!, &, |, ~  ---operators on single operands x++, y--
binary: +, *, <, >, = ---- will work with two operands c = a+b, d =a-b
ternary:?: ----- x=a>b?a:b;

properties:
precedence/priority:
normally bodmas
(), [] - highest precedence c=(a+b)*c
*,/,% -multiplicative operators
+,- - additive(equal)

associativity:
two kinds of associativity
Left to right associativity- almost all -operators
right to left associativity


Arithmetic operators:
*,/,% - multiplicative operators
High precdence and left to right associavity

+,- - additive operators

Low precedence and equal
L-R associativity

10/3 =3
10%3 =1

/,% - ****** be careful - it may lead to system crash 


Relational Operators:

binary operators
relational - >,<,>=,<=
applicable on only primitive except on boolean
not applicable on reference
equality ==, !=
applicable on only primitive except on boolean
applicable on reference



Assignment operator:
= - right to left associative
x=10; 1o is assigned to x

a=a+10; a+=10;

a=a*b; a=*10;

Increment and Decrement operator:
++ = +1
-- =-1

a=20;
a--; 19 post decrement

a=10;
a++; post increment

++a; pre increment

--a; pre decrement
