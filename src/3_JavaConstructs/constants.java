Constant
The value of the variable cannot be changed

In c/c++ - const is used 

Even though we have const keyword in java, We use a modifier "final"

final double PI = 3.14;

****Java recommendation- The variable name of the constant should be in upper case

final double MAX_AGE = 65.6;

final String name = "prav";
