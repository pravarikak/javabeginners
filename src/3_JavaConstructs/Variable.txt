Variable - hold a dataitem of some type

String[] args// args is variable which stores data of type String array

int x;//x stores the data of type integer

double weight;//weight is the variable which stores the data of type double

Variables are not present without datatype
******* So java is strongly typed language

Three things to learn with variables:

1)Variable declartion
In variable declaration we should provide datatype and variable name
int age;
double salary;
String name;


2)Variable Intialization 
In declaration if we are providing the value then it is variable initialization
int age = 21;
double salary = 21.300;
String name = "java";


3)Variable Assignment
If we assign some value after declaration then it is assignment, in assignment it we will not declared again

age=22;
salary = 21.30;
name ="prav";
