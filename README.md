1. Introduction
    Where to write java program?
    -> Text editors - Which allows Upper Case, Lower Case (A-Z), 0-9 and some special symbols. Example - Notepad, Text edit.
    -> Rich Text editors - Have the language support, Understands keywords and variables. Example - Notepad++, sublime text, atom.
    -> IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - Example - Eclipse, IntelliJ idea, VS Code, Net Beans
    Extension for java program? is .java
    How to download java - java is owned by oracle, oracle.com/java
    How to compile java - Compilation is the converting High level language to system understable language -- .java is converted to byte code(.class). Command for compiler is javac
    How to intrepret java - .class is interpreted by interpreter(JVM). JVM Executes .class file line by line. Command for interpreter is java.
    *** javac -version gives complier java version.
    java -version gives java version
    java p - is the command to see .class file
    Compiler- Checks for syntax errors, ends with semi colon.
3. Naming Convention
    For class and Interfaces - Camel Casing, Every first letter of the word should be capital. Example - HelloWorldProgram
    For methods and variables - First word should be lower case, remaining words should be camel casing. Example - helloWorldProgram.
4. Execution of java program
    When we use java command to interpret and execute the code - it first looks for the main method
    Every java class must have one class.
    The main method is called by interpreter(JVM).
    Main method should be public so that it can be accessed anytime.
    Static method can be called without the need of object. Can be called by class name.
    String is a class present in lang package
    System is a class present in package
6. Visibility Specifiers -
    In java we have four visibilty specifiers
    public
    private
    protected
    default
7. Reserved words - are the keywords that has special meaning to the compiler and cannot be used for other purposes in the program.
8. Blocks - A pair of braces in a program forms a block that groups component of the program. Example - class block, Method block
   {} - block of the code
   () - Used with the methods
   [] - Denotes an array
   // - For comments
   " " - For String
   ; - Marks the end of the statement
   /* */ - Multi line command
9. Documentation - Online Documentation - API Documentation in oracle.com/java contains all the documentation.
